# Emran Batmanghelich CV
Hi, this is my CV as a Software Engineer.  
I love the whole application development lifecycle (from design, development, and testing, to continuous delivery and monitoring). That's what I call *Software Engineering*, in comparison to just programming.  
However, I've mainly focused on Backend development skills, alongside DevOps and Quality.
